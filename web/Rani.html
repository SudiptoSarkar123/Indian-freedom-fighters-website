            Rani Lakshmibai (or Rani Lakshmi Bai) was born on 19 November 1828[3][4] (some sources say 1835)[2][5][6] in the town of Benares (now Varanasi) into a Karhada Brahmin family.[7] She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu.[8] Her father was Moropant Tambe[9] and her mother Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came from the Tambe village of the Guhagar taluka located in the Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra.[10] Her mother died when she was four years old. Her father was a Commander during the war of Kalyanpranth. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district.[11] The Peshwa called her "Chhabili", which means "beautiful " and "lively and cheerful". She was educated at home and was taught to read and write, and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included shooting, horsemanship, fencing[12][13] and mallakhamba with her childhood friends Nana Sahib and Tantia Tope.[14][15][dubious â€“ discuss] Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal cultural expectations for women in India's society at this time.[16] And she was known for her unique perspectives and her courage to fight against social norms even in front of the whole society.

            Rani Lakshmibai was accustomed to riding on horseback accompanied by escorts between the palace and the temple, although sometimes she was carried in a palanquin.[17] Her horses included Sarangi, Pavan and Baadal; according to historians, she rode Baadal when escaping from the fort in 1858. Her palace, the Rani Mahal, has now been converted into a museum. It houses a collection of archaeological remains of the period between the 9th and 12th centuries AD.
